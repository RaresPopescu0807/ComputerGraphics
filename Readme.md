School work from the Computer Graphics class.
We used a framekork that was provided and some starting code for the labs.
We also had 3 projects as homework that accounted for 80% of the grade :
- a 2D game where you play as an archer shooting targets;
- a 3D Skyroads like game (an infinite runner)
- a stylized 3D Skyroads like game (an infinite runner)
